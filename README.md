# News Product Server

A <a href="http://docs.feedland.org/newsProducts.opml">news product</a> is a one-page website you create with FeedLand for people outside of FeedLand to read.

### This project is done

I integrated the capabilities of the news product server in FeedLand itself. This app is no longer necessary.

I replaced it with an app that gets the html text from feedland.org and returns it. So you don't have to modify anything to keep your product running. 

Look to the FeedLandInstall repo for instructions on how to set it up. (Coming soon.)
